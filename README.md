## Running local

You can probably run the visualization in your browser without a backend (open `index.html` in the browser). But some of the resources may not load correctly since we use relative URLs for most of our resources.

It is better to serve the site with a HTTP server, you can simply start one using Python3.
- In the console, change the directory to current one.
- Run Python HTTP server `python -m http.server 8000`
- Access the site via `127.0.0.1:8000`
